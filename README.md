# AI-Enhanced Syscall Optimizer

A real-time system call optimization tool that uses AI to analyze and improve system call performance. The tool provides a web interface to monitor and control syscall optimization in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time syscall monitoring and optimization
- Performance gain tracking
- Web-based control interface
- Live syscall statistics
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- psutil
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_syscall_optimizer.git
cd ai_syscall_optimizer
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

3. The web interface will show:
   - Current syscall information
   - Total number of syscalls processed
   - Performance gain percentage
   - Simulation status
   - Last update time

4. Use the "Stop Simulation" button to control the syscall monitoring process.
